# matterport downloader equirectangular

## What does

matterport-dl-equi downloads Skybox 360 panos photos of Matterport houses and turn them into equirectangular images automatically, this allows to view the pano in viewers like Ricoh Theta https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theta360&hl=en&gl=US  

This project is a simple merge of two projects:

https://github.com/fdd4s/matterport-downloader  
https://github.com/fdd4s/skybox2equirectangular  

## Dependencies

php, php-curl, curl, imagemagick, ffmpeg (last version with v360 filter), exiftool  

this code is designed to work over linux (as /dev/shm ram tmpfs)  

## Usage

    $ php ./matterport-dl-equi.php <matterport id>  

e.g: If the url is https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=huhpm6maGbT&mls=1 you have to run the script this way:  

    $ php ./matterport-dl-equi.php huhpm6maGbT  

It will download all the skybox images with the highest quality available (4k, 2k or 1k) and turn them into equirectangular images.

## Youtube 360 slideshow video

Equirectangular panoramas can be uploaded to Youtube as a 360º video slideshow. It can be created using FFmpeg (like a normal slideshow of jpg images), add the tag to the video of 360º panoramic using "spatial-media" and upload to youtube where the slideshow video will be shown as a 360º video.
